## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the Election Audit was to help Tom and Seth find the results of the election and turn them into the election commision.  Besides finding the canidate results and the winner, we also broke down the votes by county.  This included finding the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.
