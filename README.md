## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the Election Audit was to help Tom and Seth find the results of the election and turn them into the election commision.  Besides finding the canidate results and the winner, we also broke down the votes by county.  This included finding the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Summary 
With this script we can track results of different elections.  We are able to modify the script to tailor to the specific election by replacing the election_results.csv with another election data set.  We can modify this script to find out other information about the election and voters, such as finding the percent of the state population and each county's population that voted. Also, the canidate results by county can be found.  This script is versitile and can be used in many ways to find election results for different elections.
